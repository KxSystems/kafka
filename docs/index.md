# ![Apache Kafka](../img/kafka.png) Using Kafka with kdb+

:fontawesome-brands-github: [KxSystems/kafka](https://github.com/KxSystems/kafka)

`kafkakdb` is a thin wrapper for kdb+ around the 
 `librdkafka` C API (available on [MacOS/Linux](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) or [Windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/librdkafka.redist/1.0.0)) for [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/KxSystems/kafka#building-and-installation) for set-up.

To run examples on this page you will need a Kafka broker available. It is easy to [set up a local instance for testing](https://github.com/KxSystems/kafka#setting-up-test-kafka-instance).

## API

The library follows the `librdkafka` API closely where possible.
As per its [introduction](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/INTRODUCTION.md):
-   Base container `rd_kafka_t` is a client created by `.kfk.Client`. For ease of use `.kfk.Producer` and `.kfk.Consumer` are provided. These provide global configuration and shared states.
-   One or more topics `rd_kafka_topic_t`, which are either producers or consumers are created by the function `.kfk.Topic`

There are numerous configuration options and it is best to find settings that suit your needs and setup. See [Configuration](#configuration) above.
